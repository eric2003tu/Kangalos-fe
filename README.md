# Kangalos: Project Management Platform

Welcome to the Kangalos: Project Management Platform – an all‑in‑one web application built for the University of Rwanda and its partner institutions. The platform acts as the definitive, long‑term hub where every research project, student thesis, community innovation, and externally funded initiative can be discovered, tracked, and celebrated.

## Why this platform exists

Over the years, the University’s colleges, schools, and centres have amassed a rich catalogue of innovation projects – from final‑year engineering prototypes to large‑scale research programs seeking grant funding. Unfortunately, these projects often lived in disconnected spreadsheets, filing cabinets, and personal drives. The same idea might be submitted twice, funding commitments were difficult to trace, and supervisors had no single timeline showing a project’s path from proposal to completion.

This platform solves those challenges by bringing **every stage of a project’s life‑cycle into a single, searchable directory**. It safeguards institutional memory, prevents duplicate submissions, and offers the transparency needed for fair evaluations, sound funding decisions, and public accountability.

## What the platform does

- **Collects project proposals once – and only once.** Students, researchers, industry partners, and staff can lodge new ideas with a standardised form, attach supporting files, and assign them to the correct department.
- **Maps the University’s real structure.** Projects live inside a flexible hierarchy (University → College → School/Centre → Department) so reporting can zoom from "all UR projects" down to the work of a single lab.
- **Keeps authorship crystal‑clear.** Every contributor (lead, co‑author, supervisor) is credited, and spin‑off start‑ups can be linked back to their parent project.
- **Bakes in a fair evaluation workflow.** Designated reviewers can score, approve, or reject submissions; every decision is timestamped and archived for future audits.
- **Tracks money from pledge to payout.** Funding requests, approvals, received instalments, and spending reports sit side‑by‑side, giving finance teams a real‑time picture of project health.
- **Captures non‑monetary support.** Mentorships, workshops, and access to maker spaces are logged so the full ecosystem of assistance is visible and measurable.
- **Highlights impact, not just activity.** Projects can be tagged against UN Sustainable Development Goals, innovation fields, and nested categories, making social‑impact reporting straightforward.
- **Generates living reports.** Teams can publish narrative updates and attach results, opening the door to success stories, lessons learned, and continuous improvement.
- **Protects institutional knowledge.** Every file, comment, status change, and financial milestone is retained, ensuring that future students and stakeholders build on – rather than unknowingly repeat – past work.

4. **Dynamic Roles & Permissions** – granular access tied to positions, not hard‑coded user lists.
5. **Nested Category Tags** – classify projects into broad themes and fine‑grained sub‑fields.
6. **Evaluation Dashboard** – reviewers log scores, comments, and decisions in a clear timeline.
7. **Funding Lifecycle** – from initial request through approved budgets to received instalments.
8. **Support Registry** – mentorships, training sessions, and workspace access tracked in one place.
9. **Stakeholder Matrix** – map partners, beneficiaries, sponsors, and regulators to each project.
10. **Impact Alignment** – link initiatives to SDGs for grant reporting and strategic planning.
11. **Start‑up Tracker** – follow campus innovations as they evolve into registered companies.
12. **Rich Attachments** – store theses, datasets, schematics, photos, and presentations.
13. **Project Reports** – periodic updates capturing progress, challenges, and financial usage.
14. **Audit History** – immutable record of every status change, evaluation, and fund movement.
15. **Intuitive Search & Filters** – find projects by field, year, unit, funder, status, or keyword.

## The bigger picture

By turning scattered data into an organised knowledge‑base, the Innovation Project Management Platform helps the University of Rwanda:

- **Champion originality** – students can see past work and push boundaries instead of repeating them.
- **Convince funders** – transparent journeys from idea to impact inspire confidence and investment.
- **Recognise contributors** – no author or partner is lost in the paperwork; credit is always visible.
- **Measure real outcomes** – leadership can match resources to results and strategically grow areas of excellence.

In short, the platform transforms innovation management from fragmented administration into a cohesive, insight‑driven process – ensuring every brilliant idea gets the structure, visibility, and backing it deserves.
